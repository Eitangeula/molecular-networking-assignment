# üß™ GNPS Molecular Networking Report

## üîó Task Overview

This project performs a molecular networking analysis using the GNPS platform. The task includes:

1. Generating a molecular network
2. Exploring a molecular family using **neutral losses**
3. Comparing MS/MS spectra of two connected compounds
4. Uploading results and documentation to GitHub

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Generate a Molecular Network

A classical molecular networking workflow was run on GNPS using MS/MS data.

- **Interactive Network Viewer**:

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Explore a Molecular Family with Neutral Losses

- Node **926** was selected as a reference compound.
- A connected node, **1048**, showed a strong spectral similarity.
- Using the **`edgeannot`** feature, the edge between nodes 926 and 1048 was annotated with a **neutral loss of CH‚ÇÑ (16 Da)**.
- This suggests a structural modification such as demethylation within the compound family.

> This confirms the exploration of a molecular family through shared neutral loss behavior.

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Compare MS/MS Spectra

The spectra of **Node 926** and **Node 1048** were compared using GNPS‚Äôs ‚ÄúCompare MS¬≤‚Äù tool.

### Figure 1: MS/MS Spectra Comparison

The comparison reveals:

- Shared major fragment peaks
- A neutral loss of CH‚ÇÑ between specific ions
- High spectral alignment score (cosine > 0.7)

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Upload to GitHub

All relevant files and documentation were uploaded to this GitHub repository, including:

- GNPS job links
- README documentation
- MS/MS comparison image
